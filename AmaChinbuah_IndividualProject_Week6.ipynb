    "In this project, you are going to simulate a sales and operations planning using the zero-stock level strategy. Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An initial stock level for a product\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of month(s) to plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- The planned sales quantity for each month\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this data, calculate the required production quantity as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is this difference\n",
